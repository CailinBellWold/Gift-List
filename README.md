[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CailinBellWold/Project-2-Gift-List?style=plastic)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Our application aims to make keeping track of gifts for family and friends much easier by allowing a user to create an account, create a gift by taking into account who the gift receiver is, and what they are getting for them. Our app also provides users with a page to view all of their existing gifts, as well as an option to delete, update a gift, and mark it as being completed. Overall, our project goal is to reduce the stress of keeping track of planned gifts for friends, co-workers, family, or others.

### Motivation

Our motivation behind this project was initially to create an app that would allow the user to keep track of Christmas gifts, but we decided to shift our project to track gifts for any occasion.

## Core Objectives Met

1.  When a user views the homepage, they will find a site description and buttons to sign in or create an account.
2.  When a user attempts to sign in or create an account, they can sign in or create a password-protected account.
3.  When a user views the user's landing page in a logged-in state, they see a list of all the gifts they have added.
4.  When a user views the user's landing page in a logged-out state, they are redirected to the sign in page.
5.  When a user clicks the 'add' button to add a new gift, they have the opportunity to enter the gift recipient and description and to save the new gift.
6.  When a user clicks on the 'update' button associated with a specific gift, they are able to edit the recipient and description or to check off the gift as purchased, and to save the gift.
7.  When a user clicks on the 'save' button after having edited or added information about a gift, they are redirected to their user landing page, where the new or updated gift renders with its associated updates.
