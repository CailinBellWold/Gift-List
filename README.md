[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CailinBellWold/Project-2-Gift-List?style=plastic)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

Our application aims to make keeping track of gifts for family and friends much easier by allowing a user to create an account, create a gift by taking in account who the gift receiver is and what you're getting for them. Our app also provides users with a page to view all of their existing gifts, as well as an option to delete or update a gift if need be. Overall, our project goal is to reduce the stress of keeping track of what gifts you're getting for people.

### Motivation

Our motivation behind this project was initially to create an app that would allow the user to keep track of Christmas gifts, but we decided to shift our project to be able to be used year-round, for any occasion a person can think of.
